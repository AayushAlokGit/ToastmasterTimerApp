# Toastmaster Timer App - v2.1

A modular Python console application designed to help Toastmaster members and clubs time speeches with visual color indicators.

## Features

- **Visual Timing System**: Changes terminal background color to signal remaining time

  - üü¢ **Green**: Good time remaining
  - üü° **Yellow**: Caution - approaching time limit
  - üî¥ **Red**: Time limit reached

- **Grace Period Management**:

  - üü† **Grace Period Started**: Clear notification when grace period begins
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Grace Period Over**: Alert when speaker is disqualified
  - Real-time countdown during grace period

- **Multiple Speech Types**: Pre-configured timing for different speech categories

  - **Ice Breaker Speech**: 4-6 minutes (Green at 4min, Yellow at 5min, Red at 6min)
  - **Prepared Speech**: 5-7 minutes (Green at 5min, Yellow at 6min, Red at 7min)
  - **Speech Evaluation**: 2-3 minutes (Green at 2min, Yellow at 2:30min, Red at 3min)
  - **Table Topic Speech**: 1-2 minutes (Green at 1min, Yellow at 1:30min, Red at 2min)
  - **Test Speech**: Quick testing (Green at 5s, Yellow at 10s, Red at 15s)

- **Speech Recording**: Automatically saves speaker names, speech types, and timing data
- **Records Management**: View historical speech records with timestamps
- **Dynamic Menu Generation**: Menu automatically updates based on configured speech types

## Project Structure

The application is organized into a clean modular architecture:

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Windows PowerShell (for color terminal support)

### Running the Application

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. **Create virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
4. **Activate virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   # Windows PowerShell
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```
5. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### How to Use

1. **Select Speech Type**: Choose from the dynamically generated main menu (1-5)
2. **Enter Speaker Name**: Provide the speaker's name for record keeping
3. **Start Timer**: Press Enter to begin timing
4. **Monitor Progress**: Watch the terminal background change colors as time progresses
5. **Grace Period Alerts**: See clear notifications when grace period starts and ends
6. **Stop Timer**: Press `Ctrl+C` when the speaker finishes
7. **View Records**: Use menu option 6 to view historical speech records

## Timer Signals & Grace Periods

The application follows official Toastmaster timing guidelines:

| Speech Type     | Duration | Green Signal | Yellow Signal | Red Signal | Grace Period |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------ | ------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Ice Breaker     | 4-6 min  | 4:00         | 5:00          | 6:00       | 30s          |
| Prepared Speech | 5-7 min  | 5:00         | 6:00          | 7:00       | 30s          |
| Evaluation      | 2-3 min  | 2:00         | 2:30          | 3:00       | 30s          |
| Table Topic     | 1-2 min  | 1:00         | 1:30          | 2:00       | None         |
| Test Speech     | Test     | 0:05         | 0:10          | 0:15       | 10s          |

### Grace Period Features

- **Start Notification**: Clear 2-second alert when grace period begins
- **Active Status**: Real-time countdown showing remaining grace time
- **End Notification**: 2-second alert when speaker is disqualified
- **Visual Indicators**: Different emojis for each grace period stage
