# Toastmaster Timer App - v2.0

A modular Python console application designed to help Toastmaster members and clubs time speeches with visual color indicators.

## Features

- **Visual Timing System**: Changes terminal background color to signal remaining time

  - üü¢ **Green**: Good time remaining
  - üü° **Yellow**: Caution - approaching time limit
  - üî¥ **Red**: Time limit reached

- **Grace Period Management**:

  - üü† **Grace Period Started**: Clear notification when grace period begins
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Grace Period Over**: Alert when speaker is disqualified
  - Real-time countdown during grace period

- **Multiple Speech Types**: Pre-configured timing for different speech categories

  - **Ice Breaker Speech**: 4-6 minutes (Green at 4min, Yellow at 5min, Red at 6min)
  - **Usual Speech**: 5-7 minutes (Green at 5min, Yellow at 6min, Red at 7min)
  - **Speech Evaluation**: 2-3 minutes (Green at 2min, Yellow at 2:30min, Red at 3min)
  - **Table Topic Speech**: 1-2 minutes (Green at 1min, Yellow at 1:30min, Red at 2min)
  - **Test Speech**: Quick testing (Green at 30s, Yellow at 1min, Red at 1:30min)

- **Speech Recording**: Automatically saves speaker names, speech types, and timing data
- **Records Management**: View historical speech records with timestamps

## Project Structure

The application is now organized into modular components:

```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ toastmaster_timer.py    # Legacy entry point (backward compatibility)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ speech_types.py         # Speech type definitions and configurations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ timer_engine.py         # Core timer functionality
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ display_manager.py      # All display and UI functionality
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ record_manager.py       # Speech record management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py            # Package initialization
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt        # Dependencies (none for core app)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ speech_records.json    # Auto-generated speech records

```

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Windows PowerShell (for color terminal support)

### Running the Application

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open PowerShell/Command Prompt in the project directory
3. **Recommended**: Run the new modular version:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. **Alternative**: Run the legacy version for backward compatibility:
   ```bash
   python toastmaster_timer.py
   ```

### How to Use

1. **Select Speech Type**: Choose from the main menu (1-5)
2. **Start Timer**: Confirm your selection to begin timing
3. **Monitor Progress**: Watch the terminal background change colors as time progresses
4. **Grace Period Alerts**: See clear notifications when grace period starts and ends
5. **Stop Timer**: Press `Ctrl+C` when the speaker finishes
6. **Record Speech**: Enter the speaker's name to save the record

## Timer Signals & Grace Periods

The application follows official Toastmaster timing guidelines:

| Speech Type  | Duration | Green Signal | Yellow Signal | Red Signal | Grace Period |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------ | ------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Ice Breaker  | 4-6 min  | 4:00         | 5:00          | 6:00       | 30s          |
| Usual Speech | 5-7 min  | 5:00         | 6:00          | 7:00       | 30s          |
| Evaluation   | 2-3 min  | 2:00         | 2:30          | 3:00       | 30s          |
